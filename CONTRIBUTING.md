# How to contribute

We love contributors!

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Submit an issue for your feature or problem, assuming one does not already exist.
  * Clearly describe the problem including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  * OR clearly describe the feature request, and an appropriate use case scenario.
* Fork this repository on GitHub

## Making Changes

* For bug fixes or minor/patch features, work directly on master. 
* For 2.0 features work on the 2.0 branch
* Make commits of logical units.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* Make sure your commit messages are descriptive, and include issue numbers where appropriate.
* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
* Run _all_ the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.

## Making Trivial Changes

### Documentation

For changes of a trivial nature to comments and documentation, it is not
always necessary to create a new issue. 

## Submitting Changes

* Push your changes to the correct branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to the original [ithielnor/harvest.net](https://github.com/ithielnor/harvest.net) repository.
* Monitor your issue (and/or pull request) for feedback, and respond in a timely manner.
